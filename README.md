# Overview

In this fun web-application I was able to use django as my web framework. The salon application is able to help you sign up as a member so that you can ultimately book an appointmet. 

Django allows you to build a single project and seperate apps. The idea is that each app handles a self-contained function that the site needs to perform. In this project some of the several functions found is being able to login and logout. It uploads the members to a database.

Windows PowerShell allowed me to run the commands needed to add files, organize files, and to start the program. The command to start up the program is "python manage.py runserver". Then you proceed to the website: localhost8000

This project allowed to learn basics of Django models, view functions, forms, template, and the Django admin page. I was able to learn the MVT structure of Django web applications. It is also knowns as Model-View-Template.

# Web Pages
The first web page asks you to sign up in order to book an appointment. It then takes you to a sign up page where you can input your information for your appointment. As soons as that is set up, it will then ask you to enter the time, day and type of appointment. 
# Development Environment

The great thing about Django is that it has many features that you don't need to rely on external libraries. It is written in python, one of the most readable  programming languages.
